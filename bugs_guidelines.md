
## Bug vs Defect

The differences between one and the another lives in the fact of where and when the issue has been detected:
a bug is detected usually broadly, anywhere and it is not related with a particular task that doesn't meet all the standars in usability, testing requirements, functionality required, stability... etc
a defect is, basically, all the oposite: it is found in the process of testing a task, checking if every requirement is met and if it doesn't fail

Distinguishing between bugs and defects helps for reporting and metadata analysis as well as performance analysis.

## Bug / Defect template

**Short Title**
A small title to call this bug / defect something.

**Description**
What the user or tester has detected when using the feature.

**Steps to reproduce it**
Absolutely needed, a bug or defect is not well documented unless it is reproducible and the steps to make it happen again are very well described. As detailed as possible even if some steps sound ridiculous.

**Observed behaviour**
What the user has detected, many times this documentation also can be omitted and merged with description.

**Expected behaviour**
What actually was expected to happen when using the feature.

**Attachments**
Please, attach screenshots, documentation, requirements, references...

**Criticality**
Low, medium, high, critical, bloker... we have to agree in what means each of the criticality levels. Remember if everything is urgent, critical or priority-zero... nothing is.

**Side Note**
A task is usually linked directly to its defects and such task is shouldn't be considered "done" until there are no defects detected and all the agreed phases of testing have been performed over it.
