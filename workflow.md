**Analysis**
Analysts + Manager + Client meet and describe what the client is after and/or needs.

**Requirement acceptance**
Sanity check on the required overal feature usually performed by the management understanding the client's needs.

**Backlog grooming**
Developers + project manager (sometimes also the product owner) meet together to refine what are the requirements, what is needed and check if everything is in place and understandable. At this stage some tasks may be rejected, set back to analysis, etc...

**Sprint / Iteration planning**
When the backlog is groomed and the requirements to understand clearly what is is needed, just before the sprint kicks off, developers gather to analyse more technical details of the tasks, share knowledge and ideas, but they do not try to find the solution in this meeting. When there is a clear understanding of the task, there is a valuation (time, effort, story points...) of the task. In a healthy agile environment, everyone with skills to tackle the task should have their say on the effort valuation and reach an agreement on the work load so it is shared as evenly as possible across the team.

**Development within the iteration**
 - TODO
	 - The task has been approved to be tackled, it has been assigned to somebody and it is in the current sprint waiting to be grabbed by a developer who will work on it.
 - In progress
	 - The assigned developer moves the task along the board to "in progress" state. As a developer, try not to have many tasks "in progress" as the same time. If for some reason one of the tasks is blocked, use SCRUM meetings to notify and proceed accordingly like removing the task from the context and flagging it as blocked by another task (this another task may be living in the backlog, if it lives in the same sprint, simply take another task and leave this one until the blocking task is done. If the times comes and the blocking task is not finished, this task should stay for the next sprint or returned to the backlog until the blocking task is done).
 - Ready for testing
	 - When the developer decides it is ready to be tested and their "job" is done on it, they promote it to this state so the tester can start now looking at them and run the different testing tools on it.
 - In testing
	 - The tester takes the task from Ready for testing and starts testing on it.
 - Ready for release
	 - The tester considers the task sufficiently tested and ready to be released. This status is like the "TODO" for release managers.
 - Done
	 - The release manager has grabbed different tasks and package them together for a new release. The release has been performed and the final user now is able to use the functionality. Here is where we should really consider the task done.

**Sprint / Iteration retrospective**
After the sprint is finished, it is good practices to go through the different issues to find out what went well, what didn't go as planned and what should be improved for the next iterations. In a trully agile workflow this helps to identify problems, talk about them, find solutions and make the process for next iterations easier and more streamlined.
