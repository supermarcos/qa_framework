# CHANGELOG GUIDELINES

Nice GitHub changelog generator:

Some very interesting pieces of advice here:

We should discuss how to implement our own changelog and how to comunicate it following the RACI matrix tha we agree so everyone somehow involved in the release stays in the loop and can play they role.
