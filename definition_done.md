## DEFINITION OF DONE

It may sound like not much, but when dealing with scattered teams playing different roles on the development process, it is important to understand when a task is considered actually DONE.

**Done from the developer's point of view**
Usually a developer would call it done when the development, unit testing and basic functional test has been performed by them and pushed to the repository.

**Done from the tester's point of view**
The tester would take over the task and test throughfully with all the available tools and agreed processes and they would only consider the task as done when there are no defects detected nor bugs or side effects after the testing process is done.

**Done from the deployment / release manager's point of view**
After the (User) Acceptance Testing has been aproved, if everything is correct, the task is ready to be released. The deployment or release manager takes over now and bundles (if procees) different tasks and bug fixes to generate a new release package. When the release is finalised and the changes are public, the deployment / release manager would consider the task done.

So, since there are different points of view to consider something done, it is important to agree on those phases within the workflow and call each of them the right way so everyone can understand at any point where the task sits and what's its status.
